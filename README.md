# ToDo-List-JavaScript

This project is a to-do list using JavaScript. It is composed of app.js, index.html, and style.css files which has selectors, event listeners, and functions to get, add, and delete to-do's, as well as save and delete todo's in the local storage. The user can enter activities to add to their to-do list, and the list displays and updates itself whenever an item is added or removed. When the check boxes are clicked, the item is grayed out and a line is drawn through it. The check boxes can be clicked again to restore the activity to its original form. When the trash boxes are clicked, the item drops away formt he list and is deleted. The user can also filter which activities are displayed: all, only the completed ones (ones who have been grayed out and crossed out), or only the uncompleted ones (those who have not been grayed out and crossed out).
